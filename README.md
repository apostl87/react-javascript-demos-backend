# React-JavaScript-Demos-Backend

The API uses JWT Bearer Token Authentication, however, since limited quota is available at my hosting provider,
Token Authentication can be disabled from time to time.

This is a backend web application using Node.js.

"Express" is used as the core package, and PostgreSQL is used as the database technology.

The corresponding frontend application can be found in the repository 'react-javascript-demos'.
